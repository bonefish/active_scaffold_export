This works with Rails 2.3 and the rails-2.3 branch of ActiveScaffold.

The following exports are supported:
Excel
Enhanced XML To File (uses XSL Stylesheet)
Enhanced XML
Raw XML
CSV
Stylesheet (XSL stylesheet used by Enhanced XML To File) 

Raw XML is a rails "to_xml" which dumps the db/model data i.e. just the ids for any associations. 
All others export what you see in the list i.e. real association data. 
For plural associations, all records are output - not just the first 3 like you see in an AS list. 

I have renamed the old activescaffoldexport plugin to follow the same pattern as the other ActiveScaffold related plugins.

Gems required:
fastercsv
surpass (for Excel export)
